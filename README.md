# Simple-Game-Input-Keyboard
 This repository contains a simple implementation of a maze game using C++. Players must navigate through obstacles and reach the endpoint of a randomly generated maze using keyboard inputs. The maze is generated randomly without the use of any algorithms. The game can be run in a terminal by compiling the C++ code provided in the repository.
